Data frames info

order_datetime - time of the order
origin_longitude - longitude of the order
origin_latitude - latitude of the order
m_order_eta - time before order arrival
order_gk - order number
order_status_key - status, an enumeration consisting of the following mapping:
4 - cancelled by client,
9 - cancelled by system, i.e., a reject
is_driver_assigned_key - whether a driver has been assigned
cancellations_time_in_seconds - how many seconds passed before cancellation


The data_offers data set is a simple map with 2 columns:

order_gk - order number, associated with the same column from the orders data set
offer_id - ID of an offer



ASSIGNMENT 1:
Build up distribution of orders according to reasons for failure: cancellations before and after driver assignment, and reasons for order rejection. Analyse the resulting plot. Which category has the highest number of orders?

1- Cancellations before and after driver assignment: check column is_driver_assigned_key (1 was assigned, 2 was not assigned)
2- Reasons for order rejection: check column order_status_key (4 cancelled by client, 9 cancelled by system)

3- Two plots. In case where canceled before assignment was it canceled by client or system? Same for the case where after assignment.
- Separate the ids of before and after cancellations and then check the order_status_key on both sides.



By first analysing cancellation orders before and after drivers were assigned cancellations occur before the driver is even assigned. (73.7%)

is_driver_assigned_key
0    7902
1    2814


And analysing who cancels the most, the clients are the majority (68.2%)

order_status_key
4    7307
9    3409


Secondly in the cases where the driver was assigned, whether the cancellation was by the client or by the system it is evident that the clients cancel more, making up almost all cancellations (99.9%)

order_status_key
4    2811
9       3


And now when the drivers were not assigned, the cancellations are similar (56.9%/43.1%)

order_status_key
4    4496
9    3406



So it is evident that the main source of cancellations is by clients, specifically more than drivers after the driver has been assigned





ASSIGNMENT 2:

Plot the distribution of failed orders by hours. Is there a trend that certain hours have an abnormally high proportion of one category or another? What hours are the biggest fails? How can this be explained?


1-Failed orders by hour. How many orders fail each hour. Every order has an hour and if it has failed. So I need a data set/series? with number of cancellations(row) and each hour(columns)

1- To do this create a new columns with only the hour element of the values in order_datetime and count the values in these columns

We then realize that most cancellations occur at 8AM and are least common at 5AM

hour
08    1082
21     846
23     836
22     716
00     683
02     555
17     541
03     513
01     471
20     469
07     447
15     439
18     414
09     412
13     366
16     356
19     317
12     256
14     256
11     193
10     170
06     159
04     152
05      67



ASSIGNMENT 3:

Plot the average time to cancellation with and without driver, by the hour. If there are any outliers in the data, it would be better to remove them. Can we draw any conclusions from this plot?


1- Average time to cancellation per hour
    - With driver
    - Without driver


1- First filter the data frame into the columns is_driver_assigned_key, cancellation_time_in_seconds and order_date_time

- Useful to use previous df which already contains the order hours

2- Then separate the df into two. One in which the the driver was a assigned and another not.

3- For both dfs, use the groupby() and .mean() to find the hourly time to cancellation.

4- Concatenate both dfs

               0           1
hour
00    111.557047  293.616667
01     98.132420  247.715909
02    106.438819  303.307692
03    104.361607  292.640625
04     90.000000  243.219512
05    121.800000  314.400000
06    124.955224  272.553191
07    112.628049  188.891026
08    120.702179  189.025478
09    120.000000  216.493590
10     74.607843  197.860759
11     77.945455  258.423423
12     93.283019  240.686869
13    103.993243  248.541667
14     98.415094  235.618557
15    114.639535  206.349650
16    129.216783  220.465649
17    111.533040  248.125749
18     98.088608  268.082090
19    112.522124  198.741667
20    110.086957  206.692982
21    113.959821  214.460784
22    104.858896  232.080537
23    121.756614  284.557692

Analysing the df, firstly we observe that the cancellations are quicker when the driver is not assigned.
Secondly we can find that at 10 and 11 AM, whenever the drivers were not assigned, the cancellations were the quickest.
Lastly at 5AM, when the driver is assigned, we have the longest time to cancellation



ASSIGNMENT 4

Plot the distribution of average ETA by hours. How can this plot be explained?
